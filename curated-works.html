            Nosedive is a short film set on a dystopian near-future Earth, where an individual's standing in society is dictated by a rating system wherein people rate their interactions with others on a scale from 1 to 5. The film is a part of the Black Mirror series, a British anthology of stories that explore the potential horrors of modernization and the advance of technology, through science fiction and drama. I believe the producers draw a number of parallels between the rating system within the film and our society's idea of social media presence and digital footprint. In Nosedive, any interaction an individual has, has the potential to negatively affect their standing in society, by virtue of the rating score. Similarly, anything you do in today's society could potentially be recorded and immortalized on the internet, which can have real-world consequences. In addition, the way that characters in the film are obsessed with their score is similar to how people in real life are obsessed with their image on social media. For example, there's a part of the story where the protagonist Lacie is uninvited to the wedding of her childhood best friend Naomi, simply because her rating score has fallen too low. Naomi is so obsessed with her own score that she would cut off her own childhood best friend to save her image. Not only that, but the only reason Lacie wanted to attend that wedding was to raise her own score, since Naomi is has a high score and many people with high scores would be in attendance. This is similar to how people often choose who to associate themselves with online based on who would make them look the best.

            The producers draw this parallel in order to warn against the negative effects that social media has on our society. Nowadays, people are so shallow that they would judge people they barely know based on speculation on the internet. A person's worth cannot be summed up in a number, or in their image on social media. This kind of ideology is, in a sense a prison, and ironically, the only time that Lacie felt free was when she was in prison, and no longer had to worry about her rating.

            "The Ones Who Walk Away From The Omelas" is a short story that describes the Festival of Summer in the city of Omelas, a place of joy and happiness without a king, slaves, or other complexities of modern society. The festival is marked by processions and music and is attended by people of all ages. The narrator struggles to accurately describe their happiness, as the concept of joy has become a rarity in the modern world. The society of Omelas is depicted as being more advanced and evolved than our own, having abolished the monarchy, slavery, and violence, but the narrator admits that they are not simple or primitive. The technology and amenities available in Omelas are left up to the reader's imagination, as the narrator states that happiness in Omelas is based on necessities, comforts, and luxuries, and that it is up to the reader's imagination to fill in the details.

            One of the key symbols of the story is the child in the basement, who is subjected to constant suffering so that the people of the city can enjoy their prosperity, happiness, and a seemingly perfect society. The child's situation is meant to question the morality of using another's suffering for personal benefit, and to challenge the idea of utopia being achievable at the cost of another's well-being. The child also represents the idea of innocence, and the decision of the citizens to maintain their happiness despite the child's suffering represents a loss of innocence and a compromise of their values. The child's presence highlights the contrast between innocence and the corruption or negativity that the adult characters may exhibit. The child also serves as a reminder of the hope and possibilities that exist in the world, and the need to protect and preserve them. Through the child, the story underscores the idea that it is important to strive for a better world and to pass on positive values to the next generation.

            "The Ones Who Walk Away From The Omelas" was written by Ursula K. Le Guin and published in 1975. Le Guin was a speculative fiction writer, whose stories were reflective of the world she observed around her. This story can be interpreted as a critique of the blissful privilege and ignorance of those who benefit from exploitative industries. The suffering of the child can be likened to real-life child labor, where children in third-world countries are subjected to horrible, grueling work environments and severely under-compensated, while big corporations and those living in first-world countries reap the benefits. The child in the story symbolizes the marginalized and oppressed people in our society who suffer to support the lifestyles of those in power, while the citizens of Omelas who choose to remain in the city despite their knowledge of the child's suffering can be interpreted as representative of those who turn a blind eye to the exploitation and injustices in the world. They enjoy their own comfort and privilege while ignoring the consequences of their actions.

            In conclusion, "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas" is a powerful allegory that challenges readers to question the morality of their own actions and the cost of their comfort and prosperity. The story remains relevant today, serving as a reminder of the importance of empathy and responsibility towards those who suffer to support our lifestyles.
