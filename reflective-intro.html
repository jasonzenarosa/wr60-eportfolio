            Writing has never really been my strong suit. For as long as I can remember, I've always preferred subjects heavier in problem-solving and pattern recognition, like math and the sciences. Naturally, I was a bit nervous about taking my first college writing class. However, looking back at the quarter, I can say with certainty that the course has made a significant impact on the way I approach writing in an academic setting. In this reflection, I will detail my experiences in Writing 60, the skills I acquired, and how the course affected my perspective on writing.
