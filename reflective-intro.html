            Writing has never really been my strong suit. For as long as I can remember, I've always preferred subjects heavier in problem-solving and pattern recognition, like math and the sciences. Naturally, I was a bit nervous about taking my first college writing class. However, looking back at the quarter, I can say with certainty that the course has made a significant impact on the way I approach writing in an academic setting. In this reflection, I will detail my experiences in Writing 60 (WR60), the skills I acquired, and how the course affected my perspective on writing.

            Throughout my education up through high school, I was always taught to "take myself out" of my writing; that is to say, I was expected to present information in a detached, objective manner. First person point of view was to be avoided whenever possible, and phrases like "The purpose of this essay is to..." or "In this essay I will..." were treated like taboo. As a result, I had always thought of these things as "bad" writing practices. However, as I've learned in WR60, inserting your own voice into your writing can actually be quite powerful, and directly stating what the purpose of an essay is can actually improve the quality and clarity of thought within the essay.

            Take a look at the following thesis from the rough draft of my <a href="essays/AP.pdf">Advocacy Project</a>.

        <p class="quote">
            Although it could be argued that creating legislation with the purpose of regulating AI will only serve to hinder the advancement and innovation of this emerging technology, AI must be regulated more strictly in order to ensure that it cannot be used to perpetuate societal biases, spread disinformation, or be used for impersonation/identity theft.
        </p>

            It's not bad, but it is a bit vague, and it leaves you with more questions than answers. For example, what specific aspects of AI be regulated? Now, compare this to the thesis that ended up in the final draft.

            The purpose of this essay is to argue that there is a lack of regulation for AI technology in the US and to propose solutions to this issue. Although it could be argued that creating legislation with the purpose of regulating AI will only serve to hinder the advancement and innovation of this emerging technology, the criminalization of certain use cases of AI would help to keep the American public safe. These use cases include the police and border control's use of biometric recognition technology, as well as the use of deepfakes to impersonate or even create pornography of people without their consent.

            The revised thesis gives you a more solid grasp on what the essay is talking about, and is far more specific in introducing the proposed solutions to the problem.
